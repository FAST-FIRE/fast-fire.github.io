Hi! I'm Miao Xu. I previously served as a Research Assistant at the FAST-FIRE group. I hold dual Bachelor’s degrees with honors in Control in Technical Systems from ITMO University and Automation from Hangzhou Dianzi University (top 2%).

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Machine Learning, Systems and Control at Lund University.

My research interests focus on control and intelligence in multi-robot systems, including cooperative control, adaptive control, and learning-based control.

If you’re interested in discussing my work or potential collaborations, feel free to email me at [miaoxu010522@gmail.com](mailto:miaoxu010522@gmail.com)
