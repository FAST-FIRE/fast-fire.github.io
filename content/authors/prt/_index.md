Ruitian Pang is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, under the supervision of Prof. Chao Xu and Prof. Yanjun Cao. His research interests lie in the areas of end-to-end navigation, physics-informed reinforcement learning, trajectory optimization, and aerial–ground unmanned systems. His work aims to bridge model-based control and learning-based decision-making for autonomous robotic systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments.
