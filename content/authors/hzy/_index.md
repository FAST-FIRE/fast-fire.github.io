Hi! I am a research assistant(https://percyhzy.github.io/ZhenyuHou.github.io/) at the FASTLAB laboratory of Zhejiang University’s Huzhou Institute, mentored by Yanjun Cao, Fei Gao, and Chao Xu. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Cyber Security from the Civil Aviation University of China in June (2024), mentored by Zhijun Wu.

My past research has primarily focused on developing ground robots perception and motion planning algorithms, and analyzing the traversability of ground robots on uneven terrain. Currently, I am particularly interested in integrating large vision-language models with traditional trajectory optimization to enable autonomous systems to perform complex, real-world tasks with greater efficiency and adaptability.

I am a big fan of field robotics. If you're interested in discussing my work or potential collaborations, feel free to contact me by LInkedin(https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhenyu-hou-489640299).
