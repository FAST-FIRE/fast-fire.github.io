I received the B.Eng. degree in Mechatronics and Automation from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2022.

I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in Control Science and Engineering in the Fast Lab (Fire Group) at Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, under the guidance of [Yanjun Cao](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/yanjun-cao/) and [Chao Xu](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/chao-xu/).
