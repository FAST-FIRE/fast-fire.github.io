In 2024, I carried out a research internship at FAST-LAB (FIRE), during which I completed my master’s thesis project (A Robotic System for Autonomous Navigation and Precision Grasping in Complex Environments). 

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University. My research primarily focused on learning-based robotic perception and planning algorithms, while also exploring topics in soft robotics and animatronic systems. I welcome collaborations and discussions with those interested in these fields.
