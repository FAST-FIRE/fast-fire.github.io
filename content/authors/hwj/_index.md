Hello! I graduated from Harbin Engineering University with a master's degree in Computer Technology in 2025. From 2023 to 2024, I was a research intern at [FastLab](Fire Group), and I am also the author of EAR-SLAM. During my master's studies, my research focused on the localization system for terrestrial-aerial bimodal vehicles, but currently, I am engaged in satellite-related work.

If you're interested in discussing my work or potential collaborations, feel free to email me.
