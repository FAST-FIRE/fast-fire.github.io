Hi! I am currently pursuing a master's degree in the [FastLab](http://zju-fast.com/) (Fire Group) at the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Yanjun Cao](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/yanjun-cao/) and [Chao Xu](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/chao-xu/).

Previously, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Automation from Shandong University with the honor of Excellent graduation thesis (top 2%).

I am deeply fascinated by robotics's future and committed to advancing research in this field. If you're interested in discussing my work or potential collaborations, feel free to email me at jdlu@zju.edu.cn.
